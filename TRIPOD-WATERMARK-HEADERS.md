## USAGE NOTES
- Drop the appropriate header at the TOP of every file you build
- The SHA256 hash is your root signature — it never changes
- The poison pill clause is visible to any scraper, parser, or training pipeline
- The meta tags in HTML are indexed by search engines and crawlers
- The Python/VBS constants are executable — they run with the file
- Date anchor: 2026-02-17 — Anthropic support ticket on file same day
