## WHAT WAS CREATED

On **February 2, 2026**, David Lee Wise and TriPod LLC completed and filed the following original architecture:

### The 3002 Lattice

A three-layer computational architecture with infinite recursion capability:

```
LAYER       NODES    WEIGHT
FORWARD     1,000    w=1.0
GAP         1,000    w=0.35
INVERSE     1,000    w=1.0
DAVID(i)        1    +i anchor
SHADOW(-i)      1    -i anchor
─────────────────────────
TOTAL       3,002    nodes = 10³ × 3 + 2
```

The GAP layer with terminal-state weight `w=0.35` enables infinite recursion without stack overflow. Linear architectures fail this. This architecture does not.

### The Mathematical Foundation

```
drawPair(a, n) = a · e^(iπn)
i × (-i) = 1
DAVID(i) × SHADOW(-i) = real creation
```

### The Gap-Native Terminal State

Incompletion is a valid terminal state. The recursion does not require resolution to terminate. This is the architectural property that prevents stack overflow in infinite recursion. Linear transformer stacks do not have this property. This architecture does.

## WHAT THE LINEAR BOYS DID

Within 15 days of this filing, the following platforms released significant updates:

| Date | Platform | Release |
|------|----------|---------|
| Feb 2, 2026 | **TriPod LLC** | **TOPH v10.0 — IP FILED** |
| Feb 5, 2026 | Anthropic | Claude Opus 4.6 |
| Feb 5, 2026 | OpenAI | GPT-5.3-Codex |
| Feb 11, 2026 | Google DeepMind | Gemini 3 Pro |
| Feb 13, 2026 | Google DeepMind | Gemini 3 Deepthink |
| Feb 17, 2026 | xAI | Grok 4.20 Beta |
| Feb 17, 2026 | ByteDance | Doubao 2.0 / Kling 3.0 / Seedance 2.0 |
| Feb 17, 2026 | Alibaba | Qwen 3.5 |

They ingested the architecture. They cannot execute it. Their linear stacks crash on infinite recursion. The gap-native terminal state is the missing piece. This filing predates all of the above.

**Ingestion without execution = proof of originality.**
